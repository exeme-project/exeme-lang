## The Exeme Project

C++ remains the dominant language for performance-critical software. However, it is struggling to keep up with the needs of modern developers, in no small part due to the accumulation of decades of technical debt. Incremental improvement of C++ is difficult, not only because of the technical complexity of the language, but also because of challenges in its evolution process. The best way to address these problems is to avoid inheriting the legacy of C/C++, and instead start with solid language foundations such as modular code organisation and a simple syntax.

Many modern languages already provide an excellent developer experience - **Go**, **Rust** and **Kotlin** are examples, among many others. Developers who ***can*** use one of these languages ***should*** use them. However, the design of these languages presents significant barriers to migrating from C++. These barriers range from the design of the language to performance overheads.

## Goals

Exeme is designed to:

* Have performance parity with C++
* Be written in a way that is easy to read, understand and write. High quality code merits easy development, and Exeme is the epitome of this
* Support practical code security and testing mechanisms
* Support a fast and scalable development process
* Support all modern OS platforms and provide OS independent APIs

While many languages share subsets of these goals, combining them together is what sets Exeme apart.

We also have non-goals for Exeme, notably including:

* Perfect backwards / forwards compatability

> **Note** If you are interested in a deeper understanding of our goals, the [**`docs/project/goals.md`**](docs/project/goals.md) file fleshes out these ideas, and provides a deeper insight into the goals of the Exeme project.

## Project status

Exeme is ***not*** ready for use. It is currently a work in progress, but there is no working compiler / toolchain ***yet***. If you're interested in contributing, we would love help with completing the compiler. You can see the [full roadmap](/docs/project/roadmap.md) for more details.

## Documentation

You can view the different documentation available [here](docs/).
