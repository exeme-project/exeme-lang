 Roadmap

The roadmap for the Exeme programming language development.

*********************
 Objectives for 2023
*********************

There is still a lot of work left to make Exeme into a production
quality language.

Some goals that might show up in this time frame:

-  Production-ready toolchain, including sufficient Exeme standard
   library support,

-  Self-hosted package manager (like **go get**),

-  Expand the design of the standard library to include, at least
   directionally, critical and complex areas. For example:
   concurrency/parallelism, and

-  Migration tooling sufficient to use with real-world libraries and
   systems.

A concrete definition of what the language is
=============================================

We need concrete milestones that have to be reached, for us to gain
confidence from potential users and communities. This is expected to
include a set of requirements across:

-  Necessary language features,
-  Nice-to-have features,
-  Features that can be omitted without harming credible evaluation of
   Exeme,
-  Implementation coverage of those features in the toolchain,
-  Quality of implementation in the toolchain, and
-  Necessary documentation - not just online, but commented in the
   implementations.

A toolchain that can build an Exeme program
===========================================

Our end goal is to compile a minimal but non-trivial example of Exeme
code, and run it successfully. However, completing everything involved
in this example isn't expected to be realistic by the end of the year.

*********************
 Objectives for 2024
*********************

A major milestone will be the first production-ready version of Exeme.

Goals in this time frame will encompass the broader ecosystem of the
language:

-  Package management,
-  Teaching / training material,
-  Etc.
