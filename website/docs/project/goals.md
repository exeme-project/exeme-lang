# Goals

## Overview

Exeme is a programming language that explores a distant future for programming languages, designed around a specific set of goals, priorities and use cases. Programming languages can be thought of as tools, and different tools are created for different purposes. A clear statement of the priorities of Exeme will help the community to evaluate and use the language effectively.

## Project goals

### Community

Exeme's focus is on a healthy and vibrant community that has an inclusive and welcoming culture. While this does not directly affect the design of Exeme, it does affect the way Exeme is designed. The community of Exeme (which includes both maintainers and users) needs to last for years, and it needs to be able to scale up. It needs to support people working on Exeme in many different situations - volunteering, studying, teaching or as a hobby. There are a number of key ingredients that are needed to achieve this.

#### The community and project needs a code of conduct.

Our intention is for the Exeme community to be a welcoming and respectful place. Regardless of a community member's status, we need to have consistent expectations for how they should behave. These expectations of behaviour need to be clearly stated, both to set the expectations for people who join us, but also to help us reinforce our standards. It is also important that we are accountable to these expectations and have effective community moderation mechanisms in place. When behaviour does step out of line, we need to have tools and policies in place for how we will identify and manage it.

#### An open process for Exeme changes.

The Community needs to be able to get involved effectively in developing the language, while keeping the process efficient. In other words, we need a process that is inclusive and in which everyone feels at ease. Community members should understand how and why decisions are made, and be able to influence them before they are made, as well as provide feedback afterwards. This helps to ensure that we have a clear rationale for all decisions made regarding the language.

#### Being inclusive is different from including everyone

We want to avoid excluding, or maginializing members of the community. However, we expect to inevitably make choices that benefit some Exeme community members more than others. Justification will be provided for these decisions, but achieving Exeme's goals (namely that of a healthy community) will be the guiding rule.

### Language tools and ecosystem

Programming languages do not succeed on their own. We cannot merely design and create a language to succeed, we have to tackle the full ecosystem of tools that enables developers to effectively use the language. This includes not only a compiler and standard library, but also a broad range of other tools that enable developers to be more productive.
