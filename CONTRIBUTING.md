## Contributing to Exeme
Everyone is welcome to contribute to Exeme. Contributing doesnâ€™t just mean submitting pull requests - there are many different ways for you to get involved, including reporting bugs, adding new functionalities, or just participating in the project.

## Where to make changes
Core libraries and documentation are probably the areas that need major contribution. Any improvments to parts of the compiler are welcomed.

## Code style and syntax rules
Looking at the Exeme source code, you can easily follow the same coding style and syntax rule. It is also recommended to install **clang-format**, which can format your code using the [.clang-format](src/.clang-format) file.

## Add Docs
If you add new functionality, or edit the way that current functionality works, add or edit the docs to reflect this so that there is documentation of the new changes for new users.

## Contributors File
Don't forget to add your name and your email address to the official [**CONTRIBUTORS**](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file!
