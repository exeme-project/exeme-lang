## Contributing to Exeme
Everyone is welcome to be a contributor to Exeme. Contributing doesn't just mean submitting pull requests - there are many different ways you can get involved, including reporting bugs, adding new features, or just participating in the project.

## Where to make changes
The core libraries and documentation are probably the areas that are in most need of input. Any enhancements to parts of the compiler are welcome.

## Code style and syntax rules
You can easily follow the same coding style and syntax rules by looking at the Exeme source code. It is also recommended to install **clang-format**, which can format your code using the [.clang-format](src/.clang-format) file.

## Adding docs
If you add new functionality, or change the way current functionality works, add or edit the docs to reflect this. This is so that users have documentation of the new changes.

## Contributors file
Don't forget to add your name and email address to the official [**CONTRIBUTORS**](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file!
