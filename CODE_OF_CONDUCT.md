## Guidelines

Exeme aims to be facilitate a welcoming and kind community. To make sure that doesn’t change as we grow and evolve, we have a few ground rules that we kindly ask all community members to adhere to:

* Be welcoming
* Be friendly and patient
* Be considerate
* Be kind
* Be careful in the words you choose, so you don't convey the wrong message
* Try to understand why someone is disagreeing with you

> **Note** This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to communicate and participate in the community.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Exeme project. This includes chat systems, forums, emails (on lists or between members), issue trackers, events, and any other spaces that the community uses for communication. It applies to all of your communication and conduct in these spaces, including emails, chats, things you say, slides, videos, posters, signs, or even t-shirts you display in these spaces.

All community members should help support our standards of acceptable behavior. Everyone is encouraged to speak up in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report it on the community Discord.

More detailed guidance on how to participate effectively in our community
spaces:

*   **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
    people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited
    to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color,
    immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex,
    sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, physical appearance,
    age, size, family status, relationship status, political belief, religion or
    lack thereof, and mental and physical ability.

*   **Be friendly and patient.** We want to encourage people to participate in
    our community in a constructive manner, so we can keep a friendly
    atmosphere. This is especially important because many of our communication
    tools on the Internet are low-fidelity and make it difficult to understand
    each other. Be patient, acknowledge that we are all on a learning journey,
    and stay supportive so that we can learn how to collaborate effectively as a
    group.

*   **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
    will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make will affect users
    and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account.
    Remember that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be
    communicating in someone else’s primary language.

*   **Be kind.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no
    excuse for poor behavior and hurtful words. We might all experience some
    frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into
    a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people
    feel threatened is not a productive one. Members of our community should be
    kind when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the
    Exeme community.

*   **Be careful in the words that we choose and be kind to others.** Do not use
    insults or put downs. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviors aren’t
    acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

    *   Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    *   Discriminatory jokes and language.
    *   Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    *   Posting, or threatening to post, other people’s personally identifying
        information without their explicit permission ("doxing").
    *   Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    *   Unwelcome sexual attention.
    *   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
    *   In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Persisting after
        being asked to stop is considered harassment.

*   **When we disagree, we try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social
    and technical, happen all the time, and Exeme is no exception. It is
    important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
    Remember that we’re different. The strength of the project comes from its
    varied community: people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people
    have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why
    someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that
    it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead,
    focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
