## Guidelines

Exeme's community aims to to be welcoming and friendly. To make sure this doesn't change as we grow and evolve, we have a few ground rules that we ask all community members to follow:

* Be welcoming,
* Be kind,
* Be considerate, and
* Have patience.

> **Note** This is *not* a comprehensive list. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to to making communication and participation easier in the community.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Exeme Project (*not just the Exeme language*). This includes communication systems, forums, emails, issues trackers, and any other spaces the community uses for communication. It applies to all your communication and conduct in these spaces, including things you say, emails, chats, slides, videos, posters, and signs you display in these spaces.
 
Our standards for acceptable behavior should be upheld by all community members, regardless of their status. Everyone is encouraged to speak up in response to any behavior they believe is inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful.

## Detailed guidance

### Be welcoming

We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This encompasses members of all races, ethnicities, cultures, national origins, colors, immigration status, social and economic classes, educational levels, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, physical appearance, age, size, marital status, relationship status, political persuasion, religion or lack thereof, and mental and physical abilities.

### Be friendly and patient

We want to encourage people to participate constructively in our community so that we can maintain a friendly atmosphere. This is especially important as many of the tools we use to communicate on the Internet are low fidelity and make it difficult to understand each other. As we learn to work together effectively as a group, be patient, recognize that we are all on a learning journey, and remain supportive.

### Be considerate

Your work will be used by other people, and you will depend on the work of others. Every decision you make will have an impact on users and colleagues, and you should be aware of the consequences. Keep in mind that we're a global community, so you may not be communicating with other people in their primary language.

### Be kind

We will not all agree, but disagreement does not excuse bad behavior or hurtful words. We may all feel frustrated now and again, but we cannot allow this to become personalized. It's important to remember that a community where people are under threat is not a productive community. Members of our community should be kind to other members as well as to people outside the Exeme community.

### Be careful in the words that we choose

Do not use insults or put-downs. It is not acceptable to engage in harassment or other exclusionary behavior. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Using or threatening to use violent language.
* Discriminatory jokes and slurs.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting or threatening to post someone else's personal information without their permission (*doxing*).
* Personal abuse, especially the use of racist or sexist language.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Advocacy or encouragement of any of the above behavior.
* In general, if someone asks you to stop, stop. It is considered harassment to persist after being asked to stop.

### When we disagree, we try to understand why

Differences of opinion - both social and technical - happen all the time, and the Exeme community is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differences of opinion in a constructive manner. Remember, we're different. The strength of the project comes from the diversity of its community: people who come from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different ways of looking at things. It doesn't mean that someone is wrong if you can't understand why they have a view. Don't forget that it's human to make mistakes, and blaming each other won't get us anywhere. Instead, you should focus on helping to solve problems and learning from mistakes.
