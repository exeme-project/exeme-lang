## The Exeme Project

Hi so this is a random pet project of mine :3, feel free to stick around and star the repository if you like it! It is my view on what a perfect programming language would be for me, but with that being said nothing is perfect so I am open to suggestions and contributions.

## Goals

Exeme is designed to have:

* **Performance parity** with C and C++,
* A **simple but powerful syntax** - high quality code merits easy development,
* Built-in practical **code security and testing mechanisms**,
* A **fast and scalable** development process, and
* Support for **all modern OS platforms**, and **OS-independent APIs**.

Basically speed in both development and execution, while having a simple yet powerful syntax. For me it is a mash up of C, Python, and Go. Speed, simplicity, and powerful developer tools.
