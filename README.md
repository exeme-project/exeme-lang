The Exeme Language (from [**exeme**](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/exeme)), is an optimised, elegant, and compiled programming language.

## 🎯 Goals

The Exeme Language is designed to have:

* **Performance parity** with C and C++,
* A **simple but powerful syntax** - high quality code merits easy development,
* Built-in practical **code security and testing mechanisms**,
* A **fast and scalable** development process, and
* Support for **all modern OS platforms**, and **OS-independent APIs**.

Speed in both development and execution, while having a simple yet powerful syntax. Think of it like a combination of [**C**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [**Python**](https://www.python.org/), and [**Go**](https://go.dev/). *Speed*, *simplicity*, and *powerful developer tools*.

## 👀 Usage

The Exeme Language is currently in the early stages of development. The language is still being designed, and the compiler is still being written, and so is not yet ready for use.

## ✨ Inspiration

The Exeme Language is inspired by many projects, but namely:

- [**C**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) - A general-purpose, procedural computer programming language.
- [**Go**](https://go.dev/) - An open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) - A general-purpose, high-level programming language.
- [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.

The Exeme Language is also made possible by the following projects:

- [**Clang**](https://clang.llvm.org/) - A C language family frontend for LLVM.
- [**LLVM**](https://llvm.org/) - A collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies.
