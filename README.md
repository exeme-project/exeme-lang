## The Exeme Project

C++ remains the dominant programming language for performance-critical software. However, it is *struggling to meet the needs* of modern developers, in no small part due to the **accumulation of technical debt** over decades. Improvement of C++ is *extremely difficult*, not just because of decades of technical debt, but also due to **challenges in its evolution process**. The best way to address these problems is by *avoiding inheriting the legacy* of C and C++, and instead **start with solid language foundations**.

## Goals

Exeme is designed to have:

* **Performance parity** with C and C++,
* A **simple but powerful syntax** - high quality code merits easy development,
* Built-in practical **code security and testing mechanisms**,
* A **fast and scalable** development process, and
* Support for **all modern OS platforms**, and **OS-independent APIs**.

While many languages share subsets of these goals, the *combination of them* together into one programming language is what **sets Exeme apart**.

## Project status

Exeme is **not** ready for use. It is currently a *WIP* but there is no working compiler / toolchain **yet**. If youâ€™re interested in contributing, we would love help with *completing the compiler*.

## Join us

Exeme is commited to having a **welcoming and inclusive environment** where *everyone can contribute*.
