## The Exeme Project

C but better. It is my view on what a perfect programming language would be for me, but with that being said nothing is perfect so I am open to suggestions and contributions.

## Goals

Exeme is designed to have:

* **Performance parity** with C and C++,
* A **simple but powerful syntax** - high quality code merits easy development,
* Built-in practical **code security and testing mechanisms**,
* A **fast and scalable** development process, and
* Support for **all modern OS platforms**, and **OS-independent APIs**.

Basically speed in both development and execution, while having a simple yet powerful syntax. For me it is a mash up of C, Python, and Go. Speed, simplicity, and powerful developer tools.

## Project Status

Exeme is currently in the early stages of development. The language is still being designed, and the compiler is still being written, and so is not yet ready for use. However, if you are interested in contributing, please feel free to do so :). There are contributions guidelines in the **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** file, and a code of conduct in the **[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** file.

## Roadmap

The roadmap can be found in the **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** file.
