# üõ†Ô∏è Developer Documentation

This folder contains all documentation related to the development of the Exeme language. This includes guides on how to set up your development environment, how to build the project, and how to contribute to the project.

## üñ•Ô∏è Environment Setup

::: info
GitHub Codespaces uses devcontainers to setup development environments. If you are using GitHub Codespaces, you can skip this section. This is because we have a devcontainer setup ready.
:::

Requirements to setup the development environment for The Exeme Language:

- [*CMake*](https://cmake.org/download/) - For building the project.
- [*Git*](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - For cloning the repository.
- [*LLVM*](https://llvm.org/) - For compiling the compiler.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/revical/revical
cd revical
```

### Setting up `pre-commit`

To setup `pre-commit`, run the following command:

```bash
python -m pip -r requirements.txt && pre-commit install
```

::: tip
If the command fails, try replacing `python` with `python3`.
