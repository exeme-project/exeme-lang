## Overview

Exeme is a programming language that explores a distant future for the C++ programming language, designed around a specific set of goals, priorities, and use cases. A programming language can be considered a tool, and different tools are created for specific purposes. Stating Exeme's priorities clearly helps the community to effectively evaluate and use the language.

One of Exeme's main goals is interoperability with C++, since there are large ecosystems and codebases in C++. Exeme should be attractive and easy for C++ developers to try, and incrementally adopt, even in libraries using C++ code. This relies on Exeme having high-performance interoperability with C++, migration tools, and an easy learing curve for C++ developers.

## Project goals

### Community

Exeme focuses on having a healthy and vibrant community, that has an inclusive and welcoming culture. While this does not directly affect Exeme's design, it affects how Exeme's design occurs. Exeme's community (which includes both maintainers and users), needs to last for years, and has to be capable of scaling up. It needs to support people working on Exeme across a wide range of situations - as spare time contributors, students, teachers, or as a hobby. There are several key ingredients required to achieve this.

* **The community and project needs a code of conduct.** We want Exeme's community to be welcoming and respectful. We need consistent expectations for how every community member should behave, regardless of their status in the community. These expectations around conduct need to be clearly expressed, both to set expectations for people joining, but to also help reinforce our standards. It is also important that we hold ourselves accountable to these expectations, and have effective mechanisms in place to moderate the communnity. When behavior steps out of line, we need tools, and policies for how we will recognise and control it.
* **An open process for Exeme changes.** The community needs to be able to effectively engage in the evolution of the language, while keeping the process efficient. This means we need an inclusive process where everyone feels comfortable participating. Community members should understand how and why decisions are made, and have the ability to influence them before they occur, as well as give feedback afterwards. This process ensures we have clear rationales for all decisions relating to the language.
