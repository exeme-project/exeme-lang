## Overview

Exeme is a programming language that explores a distant future for the C++ programming language, deesigned around a specific set of goals, priorities, and use cases. A programming language can be considered a tool, and different tools are created for specific purposes. Stating Exeme's priorities clearly helps the community to effectively evaluate and use the language.

One of Exeme's main goals is interoperability with C++, since there are large ecosystems and codebases in C++. Exeme should be attractive and easy for C++ developers to try, and incrementally adopt, even in libraries using C++ code. This relies on Exeme having high-performance interoperability with C++, migration tools, and an easy learing curve for C++ developers.
